ros-indigo-camera-calibration (1.12.8-0saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * install scripts in the local bin (they are now rosrun-able again)
    fixes #93 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/93>
  * fix default Constructor for OpenCV flags
    this does not change anything in practice as the flag is set by the node.
    It just fixes the test.

ros-indigo-camera-calibration (1.12.6-0saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * make sure the GUI is started in its processing thread and fix a typo
    This fully fixes #85 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/85>
  * fix bad call to save an image
  * have display be in its own thread
    that could be a fix for #85 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/85>
  * fix bad usage of Numpy
    fixes #89 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/89>
  * fix asymmetric circle calibration
    fixes #35 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/35>
  * add more tests
  * improve unittests to include all patterns
  * install Python scripts properly
    and fixes #86 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/86>
  * fix typo that leads to segfault
    fixes #84 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/84>
  * also print self.report() on calibrate ... allows to use the params without having to commit them (e.g. for extrensic calibration between to cameras not used as stereo pair)
  * fixes #76 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/76>
    Move Python approximate time synchronizer to ros_comm
  * remove all trace of cv in Python (use cv2)
  * remove deprecated file (as mentioned in its help)
  * fixes #25 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/25>
    This is just removing deprecated options that were around since diamondback
  * fixes #74 <https://github.com/ros-perception/image_pipeline/issues/74>
    calibrator.py is now using the cv2 only API when using cv_bridge.
    The API got changed too but it seems to only be used internally.
